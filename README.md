## About
The Coders Corner is a community of coders that come together to share their knowledge and help each other grow as developers. It's a full stack web application where users can create an account, log in, and post questions and answers. The application is built using the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, and utilizes Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize ORM to interact with a MySQL database, and the Express.js API for routing.

To ensure the security of user information, the application uses various npm packages such as Express-Session for user authentication, Bcrypt to hash passwords, and dotenv to store sensitive data in an environment variable file. The session data is stored in the MySQL database using the Connect-Session-Sequelize npm package. In summary, The Coders Corner is a well-rounded application that uses various technologies to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for coders to collaborate and grow.
